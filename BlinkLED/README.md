# AVR  Interrupt-Driven UART with stdio redirect

## Overview

Demonstration of General I/O, e.g. Blink an LED. 

Referance ATmega328 datasheet 14.0 I/O-Ports

Toolchain setup http://epccs.org/indexes/Document/DvlpNotes/LinuxBoxCrossCompiler.html

Elliot Williams of <http://hackaday.com/2016/03/15/embed-with-elliot-microcontroller-makefiles> got me looking at Makefiles

Hacked DigitalPin.h from William Greiman so it works with plane C, but still looks a little like Wiring.
