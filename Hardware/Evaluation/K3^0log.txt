Note: the charge controler seems to have been damaged from equalizing last night at just over 15V. In the morning it started normaly and then quit after it switched from MPPT to CV mode. I am not able to start it up again, but see nothing wrong. I happon to have had the analog command going so this is the data at the end of its life.

The chip is rated at an absolute maximum voltage of 15V on the current sense pins. This shows that the charge controler will fail when a equalizing charge is done with the RPUno connected.
