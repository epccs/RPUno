# I am using an AGM SLA battery and it is not working like the other SLA I tried.
# AGM can tolerate some hydrogen gassing at up to 15V so I have removed the battery thermistor to allow 
# charging up to about 14.3V. A little low for flooded or large AGM, but that is at the ede where 
# gassing starts when it is hot (and it is hot).

I pulled the battery just before the sun went down and tried to charge it with a Duracell SLC10003 charger, it decided the battery was at a full charge within a few minutes. The SLC10003 goes to 14.5V with 1.5A so I guess the 150mA is doing the job even though I don't see it even reach 14.3V.

The LED string on DIO12 that was intermittent would not stop acting up until I soldered the LED"s to the wires. Looks like the plating on the LED pins is oxidizing (they look black like tarnish) so perhaps some micro welding occurs each time current flows.
