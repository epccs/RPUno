# AVR  Interrupt-Driven UART with stdio redirect

## Overview

Uart is an interactive command line program that demonstrates stdio redirect of a minimalized interrupt-driven UART core. 

Referance ATmega328 datasheet 20.0 USART0 Universal Synchronous and Asynchronous serial Receiver and Transmitter.

## Firmware Upload

With a serial port connection (set the BOOT_PORT in Makefile) and optiboot installed on the RPUno run 'make bootload' and it should compile and then flash the MCU.

``` 
rsutherland@conversion:~/Samba/RPUno/Uart$ make bootload
...
avrdude done.  Thank you.
``` 

Now connect with picocom (or ilk). Note I am often at another computer doing this through SSH. The Samba folder is for editing the files from Windows.

``` 
#exit is C-a, C-x
picocom -b 38400 /dev/ttyUSB0
``` 


# Commands

Commands are interactive over the serial interface at 38400 baud rate. The echo will start after the second character of a new line. 


## /\[rpu_address\]/\[command \[arg\]\]

rpu_address is taken from the I2C address 0x29 (e.g. get_Rpu_address() which is included form ../lib/rpu_mgr.h). The value of rpu_address is used as a character in a string, which means don't use a null value (C strings are null terminated) as an adddress. The ASCII value for '1' (0x31) is easy and looks nice, though I fear it will cause some confusion when it is discovered that the actual address value is 49.

Commands and their arguments follow.

## /0/id? \[name|desc|avr-gcc\]
