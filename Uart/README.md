# AVR  Interrupt-Driven UART with stdio redirect

## Overview

Demonstration of stdio to interrupt-driven UART redirect. 

Referance ATmega328 datasheet 20.0 USART0 Universal Synchronous and Asynchronous serial Receiver and Transmitter.

Toolchain setup http://epccs.org/indexes/Document/DvlpNotes/LinuxBoxCrossCompiler.html

Makefile based. Without the extras to increase transparentcly. The tools work in the way they were designed. 

Minimalized Interrupt-driven UART code from <https://github.com/hwstar/avr-uart>, and added streams from <https://github.com/andygock/avr-uart>

# /0/id? [name|desc|avr-gcc]

Just somthing to see it gives a JSON reply.

Type /0 to see an echo, then it is somewhat keyboard friendly.
