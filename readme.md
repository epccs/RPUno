[RPUno](http://epccs.org/indexes/Board/RPUno/) Board development and hardware.

This repository is a mix of stuff for Arduino IDE and Makefile. Makefile setup <http://epccs.org/indexes/Document/DvlpNotes/LinuxBoxCrossCompiler.html>

When I start to learn/relearn something I get preachy about it, and so... Makefiles are helpful when projects grow beyond what is reasonable in a single file. I could say something like 400 lines is the max, but it is really a matter of when I am having trouble keeping a clear view of all the workings in the file.
